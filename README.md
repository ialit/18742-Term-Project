The code is located in pagerank\serial\ folder.

RTL = everythin_Serial.sv

TestBench = tb.sv for dodecahedral benchmark
            tb_herschel for herschel test bench.
            
 DMP_Sh implementation is tried in the folder DMP_Sh
 
 It does not work. But the principle involves if the NODE is part of the partition then it has access to update it. Otherwise it queues it and DMP serial implementation takes place for the queue.
